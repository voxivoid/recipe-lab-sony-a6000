# Commit and Open a GitHub Pull Request

Commit the current changes, push, and open a PR into `development` if one does not already
exist. The rules here are enforced by CI — see [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> **Never merge the PR.** Every PR needs an approving review from a code owner. Open it and
> stop.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze changes

Run in parallel:

```bash
git status
git diff --cached                 # staged
git diff                          # unstaged
git log --oneline -5              # recent commits, for style
git branch --show-current
```

### 2. Create a branch (if on `main` or `development`)

**Never commit to `main` or `development`.** Both are protected; `main` is releases only.
If the current branch is either, create a work branch first.

Every branch needs a GitHub issue. If the change has no issue yet, create one:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<type>: <what>" --label "type: <type>" --milestone "<current milestone>"
```

Name the branch `<type>/<issue>-<kebab-slug>`, where the type prefix matches the commit type:

```
feat/123-brand-jump-top-dial
fix/131-wb-finetune-sign
docs/ refactor/ chore/ build/ ci/ perf/ test/   same shape
```

```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

### 3. Stage changes

Stage specific files by name; avoid `git add -A` / `git add .`.

**Never stage:** `.env` or credentials, `*.apk`, `*.keystore` (the signing key is
irreplaceable), `node_modules/`, `out/`, `jni/platform/errno.h.updater_only`. All are
gitignored — if one shows up in `git status`, something is wrong; stop and say so.

### 4. Run the gates before committing

These are the same checks CI runs, and they take a second locally:

```bash
./tools/check-version.sh                       # manifest sane, no version mirrors
./tools/check-commit-msg.sh "<subject>"        # the message you are about to use
```

After committing, check the whole branch — this also warns about any commit that does not
reference the branch's issue:

```bash
./tools/check-commit-msg.sh --range origin/development..HEAD
```

If you touched a workflow, validate it too:

```bash
python3 -c "import yaml,glob;[yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in glob.glob('.github/workflows/*.yml')]"
```

### 5. Write the commit message

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Why the change was needed, if it is not obvious from the subject.

Closes #<issue>
```

**Every commit must reference its issue.** Get the number from the branch name — it is the
number between the type prefix and the slug:

```bash
git branch --show-current | sed -nE 's|^[a-z]+/([0-9]+)-.*|\1|p'
```

Use `Closes #N` when the commit finishes the issue, `Refs #N` when it is one step of several.
On a branch with many commits, the last one closes and the rest reference. If the branch name
carries no number, the change has no issue — go back to step 2 and create one.

- **Types:** `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci` `chore` `revert`
- **Scopes** (optional): `ui` `input` `browser` `recipes` `tools` `build` `ci` `docs` `deps` `release`
- **Subject:** ≤ 72 characters, imperative, lowercase, no trailing period
- **Breaking change:** `!` after the scope plus a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- **Do not put the issue number in the subject.** It goes in the `Closes #N` / `Refs #N`
  footer; GitHub appends the PR number to the subject itself on squash merge, and two bare
  `#N` in one subject is ambiguous.
- Always end with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

If the user passed an argument, use it as guidance for the message: $ARGUMENTS

### 6. Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject

Body explaining why.

Closes #123

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 7. Push

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

Not tracking → `git push -u origin <branch-name>`, otherwise `git push`.

The push triggers `ci.yml`: `build`, `commit-lint`, `version-consistency`.

### 8. Open the pull request

Check for an existing one first:

```bash
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

If none exists, create it. **The base is `development`, never `main`.**

**The PR title is the most important string in this workflow.** A squash merge leaves only
the title, so it becomes the commit on `development` *and* it is what semantic-release reads
to decide the next version:

| title type | release |
|---|---|
| `fix:` `perf:` `refactor:` | patch |
| `feat:` | minor |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | major |
| `chore:` `docs:` `ci:` `test:` `build:` | **nothing at all** |

So pick the type for what the change *is*, and never title a feature `chore:`. The `pr-title`
check validates the format but cannot tell you the type is wrong.

**PR body** — two sections:

1. **Summary** — bullets, one line per change. Prefix anything callers must adapt to with
   **Breaking:**.
2. **Test plan** — a `- [ ]` checklist a reviewer can tick. Include the camera step whenever
   the change touches recipes, the settings store, input handling or live preview; a green
   build proves only that it compiles.

Wrap file paths, function names and commands in backticks.

```bash
gh pr create --base development \
  --title "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" \
  --assignee @me \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Closes #123

## Summary
- Add a top-dial fast path to the brand picker in `PickerView.java`.
- **Breaking:** `Recipes.GROUPS` entries now need a `brand` field.

## Test plan
- [ ] Install on an A6000: `pmca-console.py install -d native -f RecipeLab.apk`
- [ ] Turn the top dial in the browser, expect the brand to jump
- [ ] Power-cycle the camera and confirm the stored look survived
- [ ] `./tools/check-version.sh`
EOF
)"
```

Branch deletion on merge is a repository setting, so no flag is needed.

If an existing PR was found instead, update its title to match the work when it has drifted:

```bash
gh pr edit <number> --title "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```

### 9. Testing on the camera

There is no way to screenshot this UI from CI — it runs on the camera. If the change touches
recipes, settings-store IDs, input handling or live preview, either test it on an A6000 and
say so in the PR, or label the issue so it is not forgotten:

```bash
gh issue edit <issue> --add-label "needs-on-camera-verification"
```

The install path for a PR build is the workflow artifact, or `RecipeLab-dev.apk` from the
rolling [`dev` prerelease](https://github.com/voxivoid/recipe-lab-sony-pmca/releases/tag/dev)
once the change is on `development`.

### 10. Check CI

```bash
gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --limit 2
```

If `build` fails, read the failure before reporting success:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

### 11. Report

Tell the user:

- what was committed, and the commit hash
- the PR URL
- which CI checks passed or failed
- **what release the PR title implies** (patch / minor / major / none) — so a mistyped title
  is caught before merge
- whether the change still needs verifying on a camera
